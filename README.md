Lab 6 Comparing two means
================
2021-04-27

Researchers studying the number of electric fish species living in
various parts of the Amazon basin were interested in whether the
presence of tributaries affected the local number of electric fish
species in the main rivers (Fernandes et al. 2004).

They counted the number of electric fish species above and below the
entrance point of a major tributary at 12 different river locations.

## Question A

> Test the hypothesis that the tributaries have no effect on the number
> of species of electric fish.

ANSWER

``` r
ttest_results <- t.test(formula = species ~ location, data = fish_long)
ttest_results
```

    ## 
    ##  Welch Two Sample t-test
    ## 
    ## data:  species by location
    ## t = 0.59249, df = 21.81, p-value = 0.5596
    ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  -4.587031  8.253697
    ## sample estimates:
    ## mean in group Downstream   mean in group Upstream 
    ##                 16.41667                 14.58333

## Question B

> What is the difference in the mean numbers of species between areas
> upstream and downstream of a tributary? What is the 95% confidence
> interval of this difference in means?

ANSWER

Mean\_difference = 16.41667-14.58333 =1.83334

### 95% confidence interval of Mean length difference

Upper\_limit = -4.587031

Lower\_limit = 8.253697

## Question C

> State the assumptions that you had to make to complete parts (A) and
> (B). Create a graph to assess whether one of those assumptions was
> met.

ANSWER

Assumptions:

The tributaries have no effect on the number of species of electric
fish.

The distribution of the graph was normal

``` r
fish_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species)) +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(fill = location), 
    bins = 8, 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    position = "identity"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Question D

> Graph the distribution of body temperatures for each crab type

ANSWER

``` r
crabs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bodyTemperature)) +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(fill = crabType), 
    bins = 15, 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    position = "identity",
    na.rm= TRUE
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","cyan4","blue","red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Question E

> Does body temperature varies among crab types? State the null and
> alternative hypothesis, conduct and ANOVA, and interpret the results.

ANSWER

Yes, the body temperature varies among crab types as it can be seen from
the distribution graph.

H0: the body temperature is equal among all crab types.

HA: At least one crab’s body temperature is different from the others.

``` r
aov_bodyTemperature_crabType <-
  aov(bodyTemperature ~ crabType, data = crabs)
aov_bodyTemperature_crabType
```

    ##    aov(formula = bodyTemperature ~ crabType, data = crabs)
